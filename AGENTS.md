# PromptFrame Component Authoring Repo

This repository is the public source of truth for PromptFrame component authoring tools.

It may contain:

- Public contracts used by external authoring tools and the PromptFrame platform.
- Component authoring helpers.
- CLI and project scaffolding tools.
- Public component authoring skills, templates, examples, and docs.

Authoring guidance must assume an AI-first workflow:

- The human user is the visual reviewer and product judge.
- The external CodingAI or Component Author AI turns the brief, user assets, public authoring skill, platform standard API output, and CLI diagnostics into a reusable component.
- Default external authoring targets reusable marketplace quality: clear props, responsive layout, safe defaults, deterministic diagnostics, and strict upload admission.
- Temporary private components should use the platform `project_private_generation` lane; do not present one-off private work as marketplace-ready.

It must not contain:

- PromptFrame platform secrets, tokens, API keys, or private endpoints as production defaults.
- Director system prompts.
- Agent inbox, internal task boards, private QA reports, or unredacted user data.
- Server admission, artifact resolver, OSS/MinIO, render worker, sandbox, deployment, or production automation implementation details from `remotion-media`.

Before publishing any package or public skill, run:

```bash
pnpm lint:public
pnpm -r lint
pnpm -r test
pnpm -r build
pnpm -r pack:dry-run
```

Local development may link this repo into `remotion-media`, but Docker/CI/prod-like verification must install the real npm packages from the registry.

Normal package releases must use GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing from this repo, environment `npm-production`, and tag patterns documented in README. Do not add `NPM_TOKEN` or publish from a local npm token path unless the user explicitly authorizes an emergency recovery. After a release, verify the official npm registry; mirror registries may lag and should not be treated as the source of truth for immediate post-publish checks.
