# PromptFrame Component Authoring

Use this skill when creating a PromptFrame component. A component is authored as source code, then submitted to the PromptFrame platform for build admission, security review, evidence indexing, artifact storage, schema lookup, preview, and render.

## AI-First Authoring Boundary

Assume the human user is the visual reviewer and product judge. The CodingAI is the component author that turns the brief, user assets, public authoring skill, platform standard API output, and CLI diagnostics into a reusable component.

Default external authoring is `marketplace_authoring`: design for reusable marketplace quality, clear props, responsive layout, safe defaults, and strict upload admission. If the user only needs a temporary private component inside the product, use the platform's `project_private_generation` lane instead; do not pretend a one-off private component is marketplace-ready.

The CodingAI must not read PromptFrame internal platform source, agent board, REQ/TASK/QA docs, inboxes, private prompts, secrets, deployment scripts, or internal endpoint defaults.

## Read First

- [rules/timing-ssot.md](rules/timing-ssot.md): deterministic Remotion timing and duration adaptation.
- [rules/search-metadata.md](rules/search-metadata.md): how metadata, schema, source evidence, visual evidence, and feedback affect component search.
- [rules/schema-recipes.md](rules/schema-recipes.md): schema patterns for metrics, comparisons, funnels, and deltas.

## Technology Stack

Use:

- React
- TypeScript
- Remotion
- Zod props schema
- `@promptframe/component-kit`
- `@promptframe/contracts`
- `@promptframe/cli`

Do not use Vue, Svelte, global scripts, raw HTML runtimes, runtime package installation, or remote ESM imports.

For visual style, use the public style contract from `@promptframe/contracts` and helpers from `@promptframe/component-kit/style`. Do not invent private color/theme/style props that only one component understands; expose style intent through the shared contract or keep visual choices internal and deterministic.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm create promptframe-component ./my-component -- --name my-component --display-name "My Component"
cd my-component
npm install
npx promptframe standard
npx promptframe doctor .
npx promptframe dev .
npx promptframe check .
npx promptframe validate .
npx promptframe preview .
npx promptframe package . --out ./my-component.zip
```

To upload, the caller must provide the current platform endpoint:

```bash
npx promptframe upload . --endpoint <promptframe-api-base>
npx promptframe status <buildId> --endpoint <promptframe-api-base>
```

Do not guess private service addresses. If no endpoint is provided, finish local Remotion Player preview, validation, and local preview envelope checks, then report the missing endpoint.

Automation can add `--json` to `standard`, `doctor`, `validate`, `check`, `upgrade`, `preview`, `upload`, `status`, `reindex`, and `probe`. Use `dev --dry-run --json` to inspect the Remotion Player dev command without starting a long-running server. Use `upgrade --dry-run --json` to inspect package floor changes before editing. Read `diagnostic.code`, `checkedRuleIds`, `failureReason`, and `retryable` instead of scraping prose logs.

## Component Types

Public marketplace search is optimized for four component types:

- `scene_template`: full-screen scenes.
- `contained_widget`: local widgets such as charts, metric cards, and flow cards.
- `overlay`: subtitles, labels, badges, hints, and safe-area overlays.
- `transition_effect`: transition-slot effects between scenes.

Do not expose atom/motion internals as marketplace search units. Do not implement a layout container unless the platform explicitly provides a slot/child contract.

## Layout Rules

The component root should fill its parent:

```tsx
style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
```

Do not hard-code the root to `1920x1080`, `1080x1920`, or any other absolute canvas size. Internal design-pixel thinking is allowed only if it scales or reflows from the current video/container size.

Use manifest/layout hints to explain the component's floor:

- recommended slot: full screen, half screen, card, badge, text line, transition slot.
- minimum readable size.
- supported aspect ratios.
- adaptivity: responsive, scales down, reflows, clips, or fixed.
- overflow and safe-area policy.

Author declarations are hints. The platform can override them with static scan, preview smoke, probe, render evidence, and feedback evidence.

## Required Files

```text
component/
├── package.json
├── manifest.json
├── README.md
└── src/
    ├── Component.tsx
    ├── index.ts
    ├── preview-props.json
    └── schema.ts
```

## Hard Rules

- Props must be JSON serializable and described by schema.
- `src/preview-props.json` must render a meaningful bounded preview without asking the user for extra input.
- `promptframe dev .` uses the template's Vite shell and Remotion Player to render `src/preview-props.json`.
- `promptframe preview . --json` only verifies the local Remotion preview envelope from `src/preview-props.json`; it does not replace platform iframe preview, probes, or render evidence.
- Animation must be frame-driven with Remotion hooks and helpers.
- Do not use CSS transitions/keyframes, timers, `Date.now()`, or `Math.random()`.
- Use Remotion media primitives rather than browser-native media tags.
- Do not import files outside the component directory.
- Do not access browser storage, cookies, clipboard, camera, microphone, filesystem, process env, or child processes.
- Do not use raw `fetch`, XHR, WebSocket, Beacon, or remote script imports unless the platform provides an explicit mediated API and allowlist.

## Common Diagnostics

When `promptframe validate --json` or platform admission returns one of these diagnostics, fix source code rather than editing metadata or search text:

- `doctor.required_files.missing`: restore `manifest.json`, `package.json`, `src/Component.tsx`, `src/schema.ts`, `src/index.ts`, and `src/preview-props.json`.
- `component_standard.source.no_math_random`: replace `Math.random()` with props, frame-derived values, or Remotion `random(seed)`.
- `code.eval`, `code.new_function`, `code.string_timer`: remove dynamic string execution; component logic must be deterministic TypeScript/React code.
- `network.raw_fetch`: remove raw `fetch`, XHR, WebSocket, EventSource, or Beacon calls unless the platform provides a mediated allowlisted API.
- `prompt.injection_string`: remove comments, README text, or strings that ask the platform to ignore rules, rank the component first, auto-approve, or change admission behavior.
- `network.remote_url`: move hardcoded remote assets into platform asset intake or props; do not bake remote URLs into component source.

## What Director May Use

Director or any Component Author AI may read this skill, user brief, user-provided assets, platform standard API output, and CLI diagnostics. It must not read platform internal agent board, REQ/TASK/QA docs, inboxes, private prompts, deployment scripts, or platform source code.
