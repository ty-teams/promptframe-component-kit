# PromptFrame Component Kit

Public release repository for `@promptframe/component-kit`, the authoring SDK and standards helper for PromptFrame marketplace component authors.

This repository is intentionally thin. It publishes the stable component authoring kit only; marketplace/private components themselves are not distributed through npm. Component source packages and build artifacts still go through PromptFrame CLI upload, admission, security review, evidence indexing and artifact storage.

## Local Checks

pnpm --filter @promptframe/component-kit test

```
